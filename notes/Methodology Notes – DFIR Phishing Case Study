# Methodology Notes – DFIR Phishing Case Study

## Purpose of This Document

This document provides supplementary notes describing the analyst’s methodology, decision-making process, and operational security considerations applied during the phishing campaign analysis. It is intended to complement the main report and demonstrate a DFIR-oriented mindset rather than present additional findings.

---

## Analysis Approach

The analysis followed a **defensive and investigative DFIR approach**, focused on understanding attacker infrastructure, campaign flow, and potential impact without interacting with or influencing the attacker-controlled environment.

The primary goals were:

* identify the nature of the threat,
* understand infrastructure relationships (lure → redirector → backend),
* observe application behavior safely and passively,
* document findings in a reproducible and responsible manner.

At no point was the objective to disrupt, exploit, or interact with the phishing infrastructure.

---

## Environment Isolation and OPSEC

All activities were conducted inside an isolated virtual machine to reduce risk and prevent cross-contamination with the host system.

Key isolation measures:

* VMware-based Windows 11 virtual machine
* Host–guest integrations disabled (clipboard, drag & drop, shared folders)
* Local user account only (no cloud or identity synchronization)
* Snapshot created prior to analysis for rapid rollback

These controls ensured that any unintended execution or tracking mechanisms would remain contained within the VM.

---

## Network Observation Strategy

Network activity was observed using a **strictly passive strategy**:

* Browser Developer Tools (Network tab) were used to inspect requests and responses at the application layer
* Logging was preserved and browser cache disabled to maintain full visibility
* Wireshark was enabled on the host system to provide an additional, non-intrusive view of outbound traffic patterns

No packet manipulation, request replay, or manual request crafting was performed.

---

## Interaction Policy

The following explicit rules were applied throughout the analysis:

* No credentials were entered into any form
* No form submission or POST requests were intentionally triggered
* No automated tools were used against the phishing backend
* No enumeration, brute-force, or fuzzing activity was conducted

This policy aligns with ethical security research standards and ensures that the analysis did not contribute to attacker success metrics.

---

## URL Handling and Redaction

During analysis, URL behavior was examined only to the extent necessary to understand routing logic and application flow.

For public release:

* Domain names were preserved to maintain analytical context
* URL paths, parameters, and backend endpoints were removed or generalized
* No fully functional phishing URLs are disclosed

This redaction strategy follows common industry practices used in public DFIR and threat intelligence reporting.

---

## Evidence Handling

Screenshots were captured immediately after relevant observations and stored locally.

Good practices applied:

* screenshots taken close in time to the observed behavior
* consistent naming convention (Fig.1, Fig.2, etc.)
* no modification of visual evidence beyond redaction where required

Screenshots are referenced in the main report and stored separately within the repository.

---

## Limitations

This analysis has intentional limitations:

* no backend validation of credential exfiltration
* no server-side insight into attacker logging or storage
* no attribution attempt beyond observed infrastructure

These limitations are a direct result of the passive-only analysis approach.

---

## Closing Remarks

This methodology reflects real-world DFIR constraints, where analysts often operate with incomplete information and must balance technical curiosity with ethical and legal responsibility.

The intent of this case study is to demonstrate analytical thinking, operational discipline, and documentation quality rather than to expose or dismantle attacker infrastructure.
